The wide availability of satellite data, combined with the recent development of machine learning and deep learning methodologies applied to the computer vision field, makes it extremely interesting to apply the aforementioned techniques to the field of automatic burned area detection. One of the main issues in such a context is the limited amount of labeled data, especially in the context of semantic segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a publicly available dataset for the burned area detection problem for semantic segmentation. The dataset contains 73 satellite images of different forests damaged by wildfires across Europe with a resolution of up to 10m per pixel. Data were collected from the Sentinel-2 L2A satellite mission and the target labels were generated from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) annotations, with five different severity levels, ranging from undamaged to completely destroyed. Finally, we report the benchmark values obtained by applying a Convolutional Neural Network on the proposed dataset to address the burned area identification problem.},

	abstract = {In recent years, wildfires have posed a significant challenge due to their increasing frequency and severity. For this reason, accurate delineation of burned areas is crucial for environmental monitoring and post-fire assessment. However, traditional approaches relying on binary segmentation models often struggle to achieve robust and accurate results, especially when trained from scratch, due to limited resources and the inherent imbalance of this segmentation task. We propose to address these limitations in two ways: first, we construct an ad-hoc dataset to cope with the limited resources, combining information from Sentinel-2 feeds with Copernicus activations and other data sources. In this dataset, we provide annotations for multiple tasks, including burned area delineation and land cover segmentation. Second, we propose a multitask learning framework that incorporates land cover classification as an auxiliary task to enhance the robustness and performance of the burned area segmentation models. We compare the performance of different models, including UPerNet and SegFormer, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to standard binary segmentation.},

	abstract = {Wildfires are common disasters that have long-lasting climate effects and serious ecological, social, and economic effects due to climate change. Since Earth observation (EO) satellites were launched into space, remote sensing (RS) has become a more efficient technique that can be used in agriculture, environmental protection, geological exploration, and wildfires. The increasing number of EO satellites orbiting the earth provides huge amounts of data, such as Sentinel-2 with its Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensor. Using uni-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, we proposed a workflow based on deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation models to detect wildfires. In particular, we created a new big wildfire dataset suitable for semantic segmentation models. We tested our dataset using DL models such as U-Net, LinkNet, DeepLabV3+, U-Net++, and Attention ResU-Net. The results are analysed and compared in terms of the F1 score, the intersection over union (IoU) score, the precision and recall metrics, and the amount of training time each model possesses. The best results were achieved using U-Net with the ResNet50 encoder, with F1-score of 98.78\% and IoU of 97.38\%, and we developed it into a pre-trained DL Package (DLPK) model that is able to detect and monitor the wildfire from Sentinel-2 images automatically.},

	abstract = {Forest wildfires represent one of the catastrophic events that, over the last decades, caused huge environmental and humanitarian damage. In addition to a significant amount of carbon dioxide emission, they are a source of risk to society in both short-term (e.g., temporary city evacuation due to fire) and long-term (e.g., higher risks of landslides) cases. Consequently, the availability of tools to support local authorities in automatically identifying burned areas plays an important role in the continuous monitoring requirement to alleviate the aftereffects of such catastrophic events. The great availability of satellite acquisitions coupled with computer vision techniques represents an important step in developing such tools. This paper introduces a novel open dataset that tackles the burned area delineation problem, a binary segmentation problem applied to satellite imagery. The presented resource consists of pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2 L2A acquisitions of California forest fires that took place from 2015 to 2022. Raster annotations were generated from the data released by California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Moreover, in conjunction with the dataset, we release three different baselines based on spectral indexes analyses, SegFormer, and U-Net models.},

The main goal of this study is to apply medium resolution sensors (Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 MSI) to produce burnt area severity maps that will include small ﬁres ({\textless}100 ha) in order to improve burnt area detection and mapping in Kenya. Normalized burnt area indices were generated for speciﬁed pre- and post-ﬁre periods. The difference between pre- and post-ﬁre Normalized Burnt Ration (NBR) was used to compute δNBR index depicting forest disturbance by ﬁre events. Thresholded classes were derived from the computed δNBR indices to obtain burnt severity maps. The spatial and temporal agreements of the Burnt area detection dates were validated by comparing against the MODIS MCD641 500 m products and MODIS Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) 1 km daily product hot-spot acquisition dates. This approach was implemented on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform with a simple user interface that allows users to auto-generate burnt area maps and statistics. The operational GEE application developed can be used to obtain burnt area severity maps and statistics that allow for initial accurate approximation of ﬁre damage.},

	abstract = {Forest fires are natural events that occur in numerous ecosystems worldwide and cause significant damage to human, ecological and socio-economic factors. It is also crucial to obtain useful information on the distribution and density of burned areas on large scale. An efficient way to map large regions is through remote sensing (RS). Nevertheless, the complex scenario and similar spectral signature of features in multispectral bands can lead to many false positives, making it difficult to extract the burned areas accurately. Multispectral data from Sentinel-2 satellite images allow the development of novel burned area indices, as more spectral data is recorded in the Red-Edge region. This research aims to develop a new burned area detection index (BADI) at 20 m spatial resolution in the google earth engine platform to detect the wildfire-affected areas in southwest of Iran using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The BADI spectral index has been specially designed to take benefit of the Sentinel-2 spectral bands and use a spectral combination of bands that are reasonable for post-fire burned regions detection. The final results indicated that the proposed index by applying a post-processing stage works well in the case of the study area to identify the burned areas. At the same time, it can satisfactorily suppress the complicated and irrelevant changes in the scene. Furthermore, the BADI index is rapid and can provide the burned areas map in near real-time. According to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) reference data, maps of the burned areas were produced with a kappa coefficient of 0.92 and an overall accuracy of 92.15\%, which demonstrated a good result in comparison to similar spectral indices.},

Accurate and up to date information on areas affected by fire is critical to better understand drivers of fire activity, as well as its relevance for biogeochemical cycles, climate, air quality, and to aid fire management. Mapping burned areas was traditionally done from field sketches. With the launch of the first Earth observation satellites, remote sensing quickly became a more practical alternative to detect burned areas, as they provide timely regional and global coverage of fire occurrence. This review paper explores the physical basis to detect burned area from satellite observations, describes the historical trends of using satellite sensors to monitor burned areas, summarizes the most recent approaches to map burned areas and evaluates the existing burned area products (both at global and regional scales). Finally, it identifies potential future opportunities to further improve burned area detection from Earth observation satellites.},

	abstract = {Wildfires have major ecological, social and economic consequences. Information about the extent of burned areas is essential to assess these consequences and can be derived from remote sensing data. Over the last years, several methods have been developed to segment burned areas with satellite imagery. However, these methods mostly require extensive preprocessing, while deep learning techniques—which have successfully been applied to other segmentation tasks—have yet to be fully explored. In this work, we combine sensor-specific and methodological developments from the past few years and suggest an automatic processing chain, based on deep learning, for burned area segmentation using mono-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. In particular, we created a new training and validation dataset, which is used to train a convolutional neural network based on a U-Net architecture. We performed several tests on the input data and reached optimal network performance using the spectral bands of the visual, near infrared and shortwave infrared domains. The final segmentation model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.98 and a kappa coefficient of 0.94.},

	abstract = {The free-availability of global coverage Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data provides the opportunity for systematic generation of medium spatial resolution land products. This paper presents a combined Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 burned area mapping algorithm. The data handling integrates recent research on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 preprocessing to generate registered, surface nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) sensor time series that are used as an input. The different sensor data are combined through a random forest change regression, trained with synthetic data built from laboratory and field spectra and using a spectral model of fire effects on reflectance. The random forest regression is applied independently at each gridded 30 m pixel location on a temporally rolling basis considering three months of sensor data to map the central month. Temporal consistency checks are used to reduce commission errors due to non-fire related spectral changes, and a region growing algorithm is used to reduce omission errors due to temporally sparse observations. In the resulting product, each 30 m pixel is labelled as burned, unburned or unmapped. At burned pixels the estimated day of burning, and a single value that provides an estimate of the product of the subpixel fraction burned (f) and the combustion completeness (cc), henceforth termed “f.cc”, and an associated quality measure, are defined. The algorithm is demonstrated using six months of every available Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A acquisition over 10° × 10° of Southern Africa. Experiments comparing the mapped burned areas considering Sentinel-2A only and both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A data indicate a greater area burned and a smaller number of unmapped pixels when both sensors are used. The results are compared with contemporaneous NASA MODIS fire products to gain insights into their temporal and spatial reporting differences. Temporally, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product reports the day of burning on average three days later than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, because of the lower revisit frequency of the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 observations. Spatially, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product captures more detail than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, with systematically higher burned area estimates. Despite the areal differences, the spatial pattern of the two products is similar, as reflected by the correlation (r2 {\textasciitilde} 0.7) and slope ({\textgreater} 0.8) of regressions of the proportions of area burned defined in coarse resolution cells between the two products, taking into account the 3 day temporal bias. A comparison with multi-date PLANET 3 m data, shows high visual agreement in the location and approximate day of burning and higher f.cc values in the interiors of distinct burns than at the edges, and lower values in areas containing mixes of burned and unburned 3 m pixels. The Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A burned area mapping results are validated by comparison with burned areas interpreted visually from two date Sentinel-2A data, over 30 km × 30 km boxes selected by systematic sampling. The results mapped less area burned than the interpreted maps, as reflected by a 0.24 omission error and a negative relative bias (−0.19), with a small 0.06 commission error. Regression between the proportions of area burned defined in 1.5 km cells provide a high correlation (r2 = 0.89) and slope close to unity (0.82) and indicate that the Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A results identified similar burned area spatial patterns as the interpreted maps.},

	abstract = {Information on burnt area is of critical importance in many applications as for example in assessing the disturbance of natural ecosystems due to a ﬁre or in proving important information to policy makers on the land cover changes for establishing restoration policies of ﬁre-affected regions. Such information is commonly obtained through remote sensing image thematic classiﬁcation and a wide range of classiﬁers have been suggested for this purpose. The objective of the present study has been to investigate the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classiﬁer combined with multispectral Landsat TM image for obtaining burnt area mapping. As a case study a typical Mediterranean landscape in Greece was used, in which occurred one of the most devastating ﬁres during the summer of 2007. Accuracy assessment was based on the classiﬁcation overall statistical accuracy results and also on comparisons of the derived burnt area estimates versus validated estimates from the Risk-EOS Burnt Scar Mapping service. Results from the implementation of the SVM using diverse kernel functions showed an average overall classiﬁcation accuracy of 95.87\% and a mean kappa coefﬁcient of 0.948, with the burnt area class always clearly separable from all the other classes used in the classiﬁcation scheme. Total burnt area estimate computed from the SVM was also in close agreement with that from Risk-EOS (mean difference of less than 1\%). Analysis also indicated that, at least for the studied here ﬁre, the inclusion of the two middle infrared spectral bands TM5 and TM7 of TM sensor as well as the selection of the kernel function in SVM implementation have a negligible effect in both the overall classiﬁcation performance and in the delineation of total burnt area. Overall, results exempliﬁed the appropriateness of the spatial and spectral resolution of the Landsat TM imagery combined with the SVM in obtaining rapid and cost-effective post-ﬁre analysis. This is of considerable scientiﬁc and practical value, given the present open access to the archived and new observations from this satellite radiometer globally.},

To get hyperparameters with better performance, experts are required to configure a set of hyperparameter choices manually. The best results of this manual configuration are thereafter modeled and implemented in CNN. However, different datasets require different model or combination of hyperparameters, which can be cumbersome and tedious. To address this, several works have been proposed such as grid search which is limited to low dimensional space, and tails which use random selection. Also, optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms and Bayesian have been tested on MNIST datasets, which is less costly and require fewer hyperparameters than CIFAR-10 datasets. In this paper, the authors investigate the hyperparameter search methods on CIFAR-10 datasets. During the investigation with various optimization methods, performances in terms of accuracy are tested and recorded. Although there is no significant difference between propose approach and the state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10 datasets, however, the actual potency lies in the hybridization of genetic algorithms with local search method in optimizing both network structures and network training which is yet to be reported to the best of author knowledge.},

            Accurately characterizing clouds and their shadows is a long-standing problem in the Earth Observation community. Recent works showcase the necessity to improve cloud detection methods for imagery acquired by the Sentinel-2 satellites. However, the lack of consensus and transparency in existing reference datasets hampers the benchmarking of current cloud detection methods. Exploiting the analysis-ready data offered by the Copernicus program, we created CloudSEN12, a new multi-temporal global dataset to foster research in cloud and cloud shadow detection. CloudSEN12 has 49,400 image patches, including (1) Sentinel-2 level-1C and level-2A multi-spectral data, (2) Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data, (3) auxiliary remote sensing products, (4) different hand-crafted annotations to label the presence of thick and thin clouds and cloud shadows, and (5) the results from eight state-of-the-art cloud detection algorithms. At present, CloudSEN12 exceeds all previous efforts in terms of annotation richness, scene variability, geographic distribution, metadata complexity, quality control, and number of samples.},

Thus, this work provides an overview and interpretation guide on the following metrics for medical image segmentation evaluation in binary as well as multi-class problems: Dice similarity coefficient, Jaccard, Sensitivity, Specificity, Rand index, ROC curves, Cohen’s Kappa, and Hausdorff distance.

Increasingly, ﬁre severity has been estimated using a spectral index called the normalized burn ratio (NBR). This letter assesses the performance of the NBR against ideal requirements of a spectral index designed to measure ﬁre severity. According to index theory, the NBR would be optimal for quantifying ﬁre severity if the trajectory in spectral feature space caused by different levels of severity occurred perpendicular to the NBR isolines. We assess how well NBR meets this condition using reﬂectance data sensed before and shortly after ﬁres in the South African savanna, Australian savanna, Russian Federation boreal forest, and South American tropical forest. Although previous studies report high correlation between ﬁre severity measured in the ﬁeldand satellite-derived NBR, our results do not provide evidence that the performance of the NBR is optimal in describing ﬁre severity shortly after ﬁre occurrence. Spectral displacements due to burning occur in numerous directions relative to the NBR index isolines, suggesting that the NBR may not be primarily and consistently sensitive to ﬁre severity. Findings suggest that the development of the next generation of methods to estimate ﬁre severity remotely should incorporate knowledge of how ﬁres of different severity displace the position of preﬁre vegetation in multispectral space.},

In order to deliver rapid information about areas damaged by fires, Burned Area Index (BAI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and their relative versions have been largely employed in the past to map burned areas from high resolution optical satellite data. The new MSI sensor aboard Sentinel-2 satellites carries more spectral information recorded in the red-edge spectral region, opening the way to the development of new indices for burned area mapping. This study present a newly developed Burned Area Index for Sentinel-2 (BAIS2), based on Sentinel-2 spectral bands, to detect burned areas at 20 m spatial resolution and the design of a processor developed to perform post-fire mapping using Sentinel-2 data. The new index has been tested on various study cases in Italy for summer 2017 fires, and results show a good performance of the index and highlighted critical issues related to the Sentinel-2 data processing.},

Therefore, identifying burned areas is crucial for monitoring wildﬁre damage. In this study, we aim at detecting forest burned areas occurring in South Korea using optical satellite images. To exploit the advantage of applying machine learning, the present study employs representative three machine learning methods, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Random Forest (RF), and U-Net, to detect forest burned areas with a combination of input variables, namely Surface Reﬂectance (SR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). Two study sites of recently occurred forest ﬁre events in South Korea were selected, and Sentinel-2 satellite images were used by considering a small scale of the forest ﬁres. The quantitative and qualitative evaluations according to the machine learning methods and input variables were carried out. In terms of the comparison focusing on machine learning models, the U-Net showed the highest accuracy in both sites amongst the designed variants. The pre and post ﬁre images by SR, NDVI, NBR, and difference of indices as the main inputs showed the best result. We also demonstrated that diverse landcovers may result in a poor burned area detection performance by comparing the results of the two sites.},

	abstract = {A forest fire susceptibility map generated with the fire susceptibility model is the basis of fire prevention resource allocation. A more reliable susceptibility map helps improve the effectiveness of resource allocation. Thus, further improving the prediction accuracy is always the goal of fire susceptibility modeling. This paper developed a forest fire susceptibility model based on an ensemble learning method, namely light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to produce an accurate fire susceptibility map. In the modeling, a subtropical national forest park in the Jiangsu province of China was used as the case study area. We collected and selected eight variables from the fire occurrence driving factors for modeling based on correlation analysis. These variables are from topographic factors, climatic factors, human activity factors, and vegetation factors. For comparative analysis, another two popular modeling methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were also applied to construct the fire susceptibility models. The results show that temperature was the main driving factor of fire in the area. In the produced fire susceptibility map, the extremely high and high susceptibility areas that were classified by LR, RF, and LightGBM were 5.82\%, 18.61\%, and 19\%, respectively. The F1-score of the LightGBM model is higher than the LR and RF models. The accuracy of the model of LightGBM, RF, and LR is 88.8\%, 84.8\%, and 82.6\%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of them is 0.935, 0.918, and 0.868, respectively. The introduced ensemble learning method shows better ability on performance evaluation metrics.},

Ensemble algorithms have been included in many practical applications to improve prediction accuracy. We provide an overview of three widely used ensemble techniques: bagging, boosting, and stacking. We ﬁrst identify the underlying principles of the algorithms and present an analysis of current literature. We summarize some typical applications of ensemble algorithms, which include predicting crop yield, estimating forest structure parameters, mapping natural hazards, and spatial downscaling of climate parameters and land surface temperature. Finally, we suggest future directions for using ensemble algorithms in practical applications.},

In literature many previous study has shown that an ensemble is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers. Ensemble learning is primarily used to improve the (classification, prediction, function approximation, etc.) performance of a model, or in other words it reduces the likelihood of the selection of a poor classifier or model. This paper focus on the fundamental concept of ensemble classifiers reviews the different ensemble techniques (Boosting, Bagging, and Random Forest) especially useful for remote sensing. Random Forest is one of the most popular ensemble classifier. In this paper, more emphasis is given to RF classifier and various application domain of this ensemble classifier for satellite image processing. This article serves as a foundation as well as provides a guideline for the new researcher in order to explore the applicability of RF classifier the area of remote sensing.},

	abstract = {Inherent complex topography and drastic weather patterns together have concocted various natural disasters worldwide. In diﬃcult terrains such as those prevalent in the North-Eastern regions of India, coupled with the factors such as population explosion and improper land use, lead them to witness some of the world’s most drastic landslides with an astonishing frequency, reckoning landslide susceptibility assessment crucial in such regions. This paper focuses on exploring a promising machine learning ensemble technique of Majority-based voting which has seldom been employed for landslide susceptibility assessment. The ensemble comprises Logistic Regression (LR), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and Voting Feature Interval (VFI) to prepare landslide susceptibility zonation maps for the Brahmaputra valley region (Assam \& Nagaland) and its close vicinity. In the ﬁrst stage of the study, a landslide inventory for the area comprising 436 landslide locations was prepared in geographic information system (GIS), substantiated by news reports and remote sensing data. In the second stage, 16 landslide causative thematic maps including Elevation, Slope, Slope Aspect, General Curvature, Plan Curvature, Proﬁle Curvature, Surface Roughness, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), Slope Length, Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Use/ Land Cover (LULC), Distance from Roads, Rivers, Faults and Railways were prepared. In the third stage, the landslide inventory was annexed with the causative factor maps to obtain a dataset comprising coordinates of the locations and the values of aforementioned causative factors on the corresponding coordinates. The proposed model was then trained and tested on the prepared dataset (70\%:30\% split). Finally, the eﬃciency of the new model was tested using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC). The validation results demonstrate the mettle of the proposed majority-based voting ensemble LR-GBDT-VFI (AUC: 0.98) against the conventional techniques such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, etc. Altogether, the study oﬀers an approach with wide scope across the ﬁeld of landslide hazard assessment.},

	abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efﬁciency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a signiﬁcant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that ﬁnding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

	abstract = {이번 영상에서는 Light GBM (LGBM)의 Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB) 기능을 자세히 분석합니다. EFB는 feature의 개수를 줄이는 알고리즘입니다. Feature 개수가 많은 학습 데이터에는 '0'이 많이 포함된 경우가 많습니다. 극단적인 예시로는 원-핫 인코딩이 있습니다. 원-핫 인코딩은 1개 feature만 값이 '1'이고, 나머지는 모두 '0'입니다. 이런 형태의 학습 데이터를 희소행렬 (sparse matrix)이라 합니다. 희소행렬의 경우 feature들을 병합 (bundling)할 수 있습니다. 두 feature 중에 값이 모두 '0'이 아닌 데이터를 conflict라 하고, 1개라도 '0'이 있으면 상호 베타적 (exclusive feature)이라 합니다. 상호 베타적인 데이터가 많으면 이 feature를 하나로 합칠 수 있습니다. 3개 이상의 feature를 대상으로 할 수도 있습니다.

논문의 Algorithm 3에는 Greedy Bundling 알고리즘이 소개돼 있습니다. 이 알고리즘은 병합할 feature를 결정합니다. 여러 feature들 중에 병합 가능한 feature들을 group (bundle)으로 묶어 줍니다. 그리고 Algorithm 4에서는 Merge Exclusive Features 알고리즘이 소개돼 있습니다. Group으로 묶인 feature들을 대상으로 실제 병합 작업을 수행합니다. Algorithm 3과 4를 Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)이라 합니다. Algorithm 4는 다음 영상에서 다룰 예정입니다.

이번 영상에서 살펴볼 Algorithm 3: Greedy Bundling은 graph coloring problem (그래프 채색 문제)를 이용합니다. 임의의 그래프에 대해 최소 색상 수를 찾는 문제를 graph coloring problem이라 합니다. 영상에서는 예시를 통해 이 방법을 자세히 살펴봅니다. 그리고 임의 데이터에 대해 Algorithm 3을 코드로 구현합니다.

	abstract = {The background of the present study complies with silicon content prediction in hot metal in the blast furnace system. The blast furnace system is a highly complex industrial reactor in the conventional process. The system is subject to several problems (e.g., system automation, the thermal state of the blast furnace, and the life prediction of blast furnace) that should be addressed by professionals. To determine the prediction state of the heat in the blast furnace, the silicon content in the blast furnace molten iron commonly acts as a key indicator. Based on the assumption that the blast furnace system exhibits a stable state, the accuracy of hot metal silicon is analyzed by using a range of machine learning algorithms. In the present study, two derivative algorithms of gradient boosting decision tree are adopted to develop a strong boosting predictor based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithm for prediction. Compared with the conventional algorithms (e.g., lasso, random forest, support vector machine and gradient boosting decision tree), the prediction by using the two boosting algorithms is capable of more effectively guiding and determining the state of the blast furnace. As revealed from experimentally simulated results, the mentioned two boosting algorithms exhibit better comprehensive prediction performance than the conventional algorithms on the datasets of two practical blast furnace systems, demonstrating that the R-square of the two blast furnaces in the training set is over 0.7. The mentioned two algorithms are of certain guiding significance for exploring blast furnace problems.},

Coarse annotations (e.g., scribbles, coarse polygons) offer an economical alternative, with which training phase could hardly generate satisfactory performance unfortunately. In order to generate high-quality annotated data with a low time cost for accurate segmentation, in this paper, we propose a novel annotation enrichment strategy, which expands existing coarse annotations of training data to a finer scale. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmarks have shown that the neural networks trained with the enriched annotations from our framework yield a significant improvement over that trained with the original coarse labels. It is highly competitive to the performance obtained by using human annotated dense annotations. The proposed method also outperforms among other state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation methods.},

For this purpose, a subset of 240 samples was considered, integrated over 24 hours, of particulate matter of less than 10 microns (PM10), collected from October 2010 to February 2011 in the villages of Bolo San Isidro (highly exposed zone) and Ricaurte (control zone) located in the municipalities of Palmira and Bolivar. A chemical characterization related to the identification of HAPs belonging to the list of priority contaminants of the United States Environmental Protection Agency was carried out for part of the subset, following EPA T0-13A. In addition, the chemical characterization of metal compounds in 108 of these samples carried out was taken into account, in accordance with the EPA IO-3.1 method. The application of the principal components analysis (PCA), the factorial analysis with varimax rotation and a series of statistical correlations allowed the identification of the possible metals and PAH tracers of the burning of sugar cane. Results of the study show that the PAH associated with the PM10 originated in the Cauca River valley, possibly attributed to the burning of sugar cane in the high exposure zone, are: Pyr, Phe, and Flt, whereas the metals associated directly and indirectly with this source of emission are: Fe, Mn, Si and Cu.},

The measure is to eradicate the burning of sugarcane before harvesting within the next four years. This study focuses on estimation of future reduced air emissions from the implementation of this measure. The study results showed that without the implementation of the measure in the production season 2022/23, the amount of burned sugarcane will be as high as 102.4 ± 1.0 Mt/yr, resulting in the release of small particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5) emissions into the atmosphere at 30.6 ± 8.6 kt/yr, which is about a 21\% increase in emissions from the 2018/19 season. However, with the government’s enforcement of the measure to reduce burned sugarcane, the amount of air emissions will immediately be reduced in the ﬁrst year. In order to eﬀectively implement the sugarcane burning reduction measure, in which the harvesting methods will change from cutting burned sugarcane to cutting fresh sugarcane with human labor and with machinery, the government must provide ﬁnancial support, to farmers, of approximately 3.3 USD per ton of fresh sugarcane for the use of human labor and 2.9 USD per ton of fresh sugarcane for the use of machinery. The costs of investment to reduce PM2.5 emissions can be calculated in the range of 9.7−11.0 million USD per kiloton of PM2.5.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the association between the total suspended particles (TSPs) generated from preharvest sugar cane burning and hospital admission due to asthma (asthma hospital admissions) in the city of Araraquara. Design: An ecological time-series study. Total daily records of asthma hospital admissions (ICD 10th J15) were obtained from one of the main hospitals in Araraquara, Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil, from 23 March 2003 to 27 July 2004. The daily concentration of TSP (mg/m3) was obtained using Handi-vol equipment (Energe´tica, Brazil) placed in downtown Araraquara. The local airport provided the daily mean figures of temperature and humidity. The daily number of asthma hospital admissions was considered as the dependent variable in Poisson’s regression models and the daily concentration of TSP was considered the independent variable. The generalised linear model with natural cubic spline was adopted to control for long-time trend. Linear terms were used for weather variables.
Results: TSP had an acute effect on asthma admissions, starting 1 day after TSP concentrations increased and remaining almost unchanged for the next four days. A 10 mg/m3 increase in the 5-day moving average (lag1–5) of TSP concentrations was associated with an increase of 11.6\% (95\% CI 5.4 to 17.7) in asthma hospital admissions.
Conclusion: Increases in TSP concentrations were definitely associated with asthma hospital admissions in Araraquara and, despite using sugar cane alcohol to reduce air pollution from automotive sources in large Brazilian urban centres, the cities where sugar cane is harvested pay a high toll in terms of public health.},

	abstract = {Background: To determine the possible genotoxic effect of exposure to the smoke generated by biomass burning on workers involved in manual sugar cane harvesting.
Methods: The frequency of micronuclei in exfoliated buccal cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes was determined in sugarcane workers in the Barretos region of Brazil, during the harvest season and compared to a control population, comprised of administrative employees of Barretos Cancer Hospital.
Results: The frequency of micronuclei was higher in the sugar cane workers. The mean frequency in blood lymphocytes (micronuclei/1000 cells) in the test group was 8.22 versus 1.27 in the control group. The same effect was observed when exfoliated buccal cells were considered (22.75 and 9.70 micronuclei/1000 cells for sugar cane workers and controls, respectively).
Conclusion: Exposure to emissions produced by the burning of sugar cane during harvesting induces genomic instability in workers, indicating the necessity of adopting more advanced techniques of harvesting sugar cane to preserve human health.},

METHODS: Daily cardiovascular-related hospitalization data (CID10 – I00 to I99) were acquired by the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Unified Health System (DATASUS) from January 2009 to December 2012. Daily levels of NO2 and PM10 and weather data were obtained from Companhia Ambiental do Estado de São Paulo (CETESB – São Paulo State Environmental Agency). To estimate the effects of air pollutants exposure on hospital admissions, generalized linear Poisson regression models were used.
RESULTS: During the study period, 6,363 hospitalizations were analysed. On the day of NO2 exposure, an increase of 1.12\% (95\%CI 0.05–2.20) was observed in the interquartile range along with an increase in hospital admissions. For PM10, a pattern of similar effect was observed; however, results were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though with values within established limits, NO2 is an important short-term risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity.},

In this study, we evaluated the effect of biomass burning on mucus quality and mucin gene expression (MUC1, MUC5AC, MUC16) in the conjunctiva of sugarcane workers (SWs) and residents of an adjacent town (RTs). Impression cytology samples of the inferior tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva of 78 SWs and 32 RTs were collected before (T1) and immediately after (T2) a 6-month harvest period. The neutral, acid and total mucus content of goblet cells was determined by PAS and AB staining. The levels of MUC5AC, MUC1 and MUC16 mRNA in the conjunctiva were measured by real-time PCR. Compared to RTs, SWs had higher levels of bulbar acid mucus and MUC16 mRNA and tarsal MUC5AC mRNA at T2 and lower levels of neutral mucus at T1 and T2. In the SW group, MUC1 mRNA levels were higher at T2 than at T1, but the levels of neutral and acid mucus were similar. In the RT group, acid mucus decreased and neutral mucus increased in the bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva at T2. In conclusion, our findings show that sugarcane harvesting is associated with abnormalities in mucus quality and content and changes in mucin mRNA levels on the ocular surface. This may help explain the ocular inflammatory signs and symptoms observed in subjects exposed to air pollutants and high temperatures from sugarcane biomass burning.},

	abstract = {In Brazil, sugar-cane crops are burned to facilitate harvesting, and this causes environmental pollution from the large amounts of smoke and soot that are released into the atmosphere. The smoke and soot contain numerous organic compounds such as PAHs. In this study, PM10 and PAH concentrations in the air of Araraquara (SE Brazil, with around 200,000 inhabitants and surrounded by sugar-cane plantations) were determined during the harvest and non-harvest seasons. The sampling strategy included two campaigns in each season, with 20 samples per season. PM10 was collected using a Hi-vol sampler with TeﬂonÔ e coated glass ﬁber ﬁlters. PM10 ranged from 41 to 181 mg mÀ3 during the harvest season, and from 12 to 47 mg mÀ3 during the non-harvest season. The mean total concentration of PAHs was 2.5 ng mÀ3 (non-harvest season) and 11.6 ng mÀ3 (harvest season). In all sampling periods, the most abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were phenanthrene and ﬂuoranthrene, and the least abundant was anthracene. The cluster analysis of the total PAH concentrations for each day of sampling and the corresponding meteorological data suggested that the atmospheric concentration of PAHs was independent of the differences in the weather between the seasons. For both sampling seasons, the statistical treatment (PCA, Varimax rotation and HCA) indicated the presence of vehicle sources (diesel, gasoline, and naturalgas engines); but for the harvest season, the main source was attributed to sugar-cane burning. The data generated by this study indicated the burning of sugar-cane as the main contributor to the high levels of PAHs detected in samples during the sugar-cane harvest season.},

This study focuses on the use clustering techniques to identify different patterns in the data set. Use of neural network techniques to learn about new compressed features which can show good patterns in the data set would be one of the findings. In neural network techniques we would be using the autoencoders with two different approaches. First approach would be to use the softmax as a hidden layer and train an end to end autoencoder. Similarly in the second approach we would be using Relu as a hidden layer. Interesting phenomena would be finding and comparing the results for these two different trained models and how the pattern representation of the data can be improved by the use of these two particular models. We would be using the maximum of compressed feature vectors as the final cluster assignment. We would be applying this technique over three different data sets and would be comparing and discussing results of final clusters before the use of compressed feature vectors and after the use of compressed feature vectors. Framework discussed in this study would shed light on different two different kind of hidden layers used in auto encoder, learning complexity of the auto-encoder, their critical points and connections of auto encoders to fundamental clustering.},

To combine the advantages of pixelwise machine learning (ML) method and region-based deep learning (DL) segmentation model, this study proposes a two-phase hybrid framework for near real-time burned area progression mapping: the first one intends to depict burned area delimitation using a contextual algorithm HRNet to exclude the unburned areas outside the perimeter and minimize omission errors, which partially remain unburned patches within the delimitation as commission errors. The second phase refines the burned area spatially using ensemble fusion based on an updating support vector machine (SVM) model under the voting scheme as new imagery arrives to reduce the commission errors consecutively. The validation results showed that the accuracy of perimeter prediction using the HRNet can reach 96.77\% in Kappa. The iterative optimization can improve the average Kappa value from 62.55\% to 70.75\% for burned area pixel classification using pixelwise SVM alone. The proposed ensemble learning framework can further refine the burned area progression results, reaching an average Kappa up to 85.19\%, at four acquisition dates with Sentinel-2 and Landsat8 available during the Sand fire event that occurred in California.},

Methods: Text books on LR and research articles employing LR as main statistical analysis were reviewed. Twenty-three articles published between 2010 and 2011 in the Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing were analyzed for proper use and reporting of LR models. Results: Logistic regression from basic concepts such as odds, odds ratio, logit transformation and logistic curve, assumption, fitting, reporting and interpreting to cautions were presented. Substantial shortcomings were found in both use of LR and reporting of results. For many studies, sample size was not sufficiently large to call into question the accuracy of the regression model. Additionally, only one study reported validation analysis. Conclusion: Nursing researchers need to pay greater attention to guidelines concerning the use and reporting of LR models.},

	abstract = {The kappa coeﬃcient is not an index of accuracy, indeed it is not an index of overall agreement but one of agreement beyond chance. Chance agreement is, however, irrelevant in an accuracy assessment and is anyway inappropriately modelled in the calculation of a kappa coeﬃcient for typical remote sensing applications. The magnitude of a kappa coeﬃcient is also diﬃcult to interpret. Values that span the full range of widely used interpretation scales, indicating a level of agreement that equates to that estimated to arise from chance alone all the way through to almost perfect agreement, can be obtained from classiﬁcations that satisfy demanding accuracy targets (e.g. for a classiﬁcation with overall accuracy of 95\% the range of possible values of the kappa coeﬃcient is −0.026 to 0.900). Comparisons of kappa coeﬃcients are particularly challenging if the classes vary in their abundance (i.e. prevalence) as the magnitude of a kappa coeﬃcient reﬂects not only agreement in labelling but also properties of the populations under study. It is shown that all of the arguments put forward for the use of the kappa coeﬃcient in accuracy assessment are ﬂawed and/or irrelevant as they apply equally to other, sometimes easier to calculate, measures of accuracy. Calls for the kappa coeﬃcient to be abandoned from accuracy assessments should ﬁnally be heeded and researchers are encouraged to provide a set of simple measures and associated outputs such as estimates of per-class accuracy and the confusion matrix when assessing and comparing classiﬁcation accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {The monitoring of burned areas can easily be performed using satellite multispectral images: several indices are available in the literature for highlighting the differences between healthy vegetation areas and burned areas, in consideration of their different signatures. However, these indices may have limitations determined, for example, by the presence of clouds or water bodies that produce false alarms. To avoid these inaccuracies and optimize the results, this work proposes a new index for detecting burned areas named Normalized Burn Ratio Plus (NBR+), based on the involvement of Sentinel-2 bands. The efficiency of this index is verified by comparing it with five other existing indices, all applied on an area with a surface of about 500 km2 and covering the north-eastern part of Sicily (Italy). To achieve this aim, both a uni-temporal approach (single date image) and a bi-temporal approach (two date images) are adopted. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) is applied to each resulting index map to define the threshold separating burned pixels from non-burned ones. To evaluate the efficiency of the indices, confusion matrices are constructed and compared with each other. The NBR+ shows excellent results, especially because it excludes a large part of the areas incorrectly classified as burned by other indices, despite being clouds or water bodies.},

ABSTRACT = {A large number of studies have been published addressing sugarcane management and monitoring to increase productivity and production as well as to better understand landscape dynamics and environmental threats. Building on existing reviews which mainly focused on the crop’s spectral behavior, a comprehensive review is provided which considers the progress made using novel data analysis techniques and improved data sources. To complement the available reviews, and to make the large body of research more easily accessible for both researchers and practitioners, in this review (i) we summarized remote sensing applications from 1981 to 2020, (ii) discussed key strengths and weaknesses of remote sensing approaches in the sugarcane context, and (iii) described the challenges and opportunities for future earth observation (EO)-based sugarcane monitoring and management. More than one hundred scientific studies were assessed regarding sugarcane mapping (52 papers), crop growth anomaly detection (11 papers), health monitoring (14 papers), and yield estimation (30 papers). The articles demonstrate that decametric satellite sensors such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 enable a reliable, cost-efficient, and timely mapping and monitoring of sugarcane by overcoming the ground sampling distance (GSD)-related limitations of coarser hectometric resolution data, while offering rich spectral information in the frequently recorded data. The Sentinel-2 constellation in particular provides fine spatial resolution at 10 m and high revisit frequency to support sugarcane management and other applications over large areas. For very small areas, and in particular for up-scaling and calibration purposes, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are also useful. Multi-temporal and multi-source data, together with powerful machine learning approaches such as the random forest (RF) algorithm, are key to providing efficient monitoring and mapping of sugarcane growth, health, and yield. A number of difficulties for sugarcane monitoring and mapping were identified that are also well known for other crops. Those difficulties relate mainly to the often (i) time consuming pre-processing of optical time series to cope with atmospheric perturbations and cloud coverage, (ii) the still important lack of analysis-ready-data (ARD), (iii) the diversity of environmental and growth conditions—even for a given country—under which sugarcane is grown, superimposing non-crop related radiometric information on the observed sugarcane crop, and (iv) the general ill-posedness of retrieval and classification approaches which adds ambiguity to the derived information.},

The monitoring and mapping of the burned area by traditional and common methods are time-consuming and challenging while is vital to propose an advanced burned area detection framework for achieving reliable results. To this end, this study proposed a novel End-to-End framework based on deep learning and post-fire Sentinel-2 imagery. The proposed framework known as Burnt-Net combines quadratic morphological operators and standard convolution layers. The multi-patch multi-level residual morphological (MP-MRM) blocks are the main part of the decoder part of the Burnt-Net while the encoder part uses the multi-level residual morphological and transpose convolution layers. To evaluate the efficiency of Burnt-Net the post-fire Sentinel-2 for the latest wildfires over different countries was collected and then, the model was trained and evaluated based on them. Furthermore, the most common deep learning-based model implemented for comparing the result of burned areas by the proposed Burnt-Net. The results of burned areas mapping show the Burnt-Net is robust in the detection of burned areas and provides a mean accuracy of more than 97\% by overall accuracy (OA). Furthermore, the Burnt-Net is fast and can provide the burned area map in the near real-time.},

	abstract = {Bare soil triggers several undesirable processes for its quality and remote sensing can be a powerful tool to monitoring its occurrence. This work aims to apply multi-temporal satellite image techniques to detect bare soil areas under sugarcane cultivation and relate with soil security. The study was carried out in an area of 2,574 km2 located in Brazil. The MapBiomas land use and cover collection was used to know the sugarcane area changes from 1985 to 2019. A collection of Landsat images over 35 years (1985 to 2019) were used to create Synthetic Soil Images (SYSIs) and the Bare Soil Frequency Images (BSF) of the area. SYSIs were generated annually, in the rainy and dry season. BSFs was generated in the total period and every five years by dry and rainy season. Thus, the land use changes and bare soil occurrence were compared to categorical maps of soil types, surface clay classes and slope, and also with economic, social and political changes in the period. In general, the bare soil increased from 1985 to 2006, and began to decline thereafter because of “Agro-environmental Protocol’ that anticipated the end of pre-harvest burning in sugarcane crop. BSF in the rainy season decreased over the period motivated by knowledge of farmers and changes in management. Despite this, many prone to erosion soils classes (Arenosols, Lixisols/Acrisols) remain under conventional tillage in the rainy season. We concluded that the use of multi-temporal satellite images is an important approach to monitoring soil management contributing to soil security.},

	abstract = {The detection and evaluation of biomass burning and dust events are critical for understanding their impact on air quality, climate, and human health, particularly in the Mediterranean region. This research pioneers an innovative methodology that uses Sentinel-2 multispectral (MS) imagery to meticulously pinpoint and analyze long-transport dust outbreaks and biomass burning phenomena, originating both locally and transported from remote areas. We developed the dust/biomass burning (DBB) composite normalized differential index, a tool that identifies clear, dusty, and biomass burning scenarios in the selected region. The DBB index jointly employs specific Sentinel-2 bands: B2-B3-B4 for visible light analysis, and B11 and B12 for short-wave infrared (SWIR), exploiting the specificity of each wavelength to assess the presence of different aerosols. A key feature of the DBB index is its normalization by the surface reflectance of the scene, which ensures independence from the underlying texture, such as streets and buildings, for urban areas. The differentiation involves the comparison of the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance values from aerosol events with those from clear-sky reference images, thereby constituting a sort of calibration. The index is tailored for urban settings, where Sentinel-2 imagery provides a decametric spatial resolution and revisit time of 5 days. The average values of DBB achieve a 96\% match with the coarse-mode aerosol optical depths (AOD), measured by a local station of the AERONET network of sun-photometers. In future studies, the map of DBB could be integrated with that achieved from Sentinel-3 images, which offer similar spectral bands, albeit with much less fine spatial resolution, yet benefit from daily coverage.},

abstract = {Forest fires throughout the world result in tree mortality that can cause substantial timber and carbon losses. There is a critical need to map the areas burned by such fires to guide forest management decisions. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery provides inexpensive and frequent coverage over large areas, facilitating forest health monitoring. In this study a MODIS post-fire image at a spatial resolution of 250m serves as the starting point of an image mining based method. It involves three algorithms: modeling as a sum of Gaussian functions, kernel based smoothing, and adaptive thresholding. Adaptive thresholding serves as the reference to be compared to the image mining based method. Three spectral indices specifically designed for burned area identification have been used: the Burned Area Index (BAI), the Burned Area Index adapted to MODIS bands (BAIM), and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). The κ statistic is applied to quantify the accuracy of the burned areas estimations by relating the estimated area with burned area perimeters measured on the ground by Global Positioning System (GPS). In addition, the κ statistic allows us to identify both the optimal spectral index and the optimal algorithms’ parameters. In this work, an accurate estimation (κ>0.8) of areas burned by forest fires in Mediterranean countries is achieved, in particular if the BAIM index is used. The accuracy of these estimates is compared with the accuracy obtained by using the reference method by a McNemar’s test. Results show that our image mining based method allows a higher accuracy (the average increase of κ equals to 16%) than the reference method. We conclude that this method adequately maps burned areas, and that it may help management agencies to better understand of landscape-scale burn patterns.}

This dataset is unique as it comprises satellite imagery acquired before and after a wildfire event with variable spatial and spectral resolution and contains a large number of events, where the corresponding burnt area ground truth has been annotated by domain experts. FLOGA covers the wider region of Greece, which is characterized by a Mediterranean landscape and climatic conditions. We use FLOGA to provide a thorough comparison of specialized spectral indices as well as multiple machine learning and deep learning algorithms for the automatic extraction of burnt areas, approached as a change detection task. Finally, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-CD. Our benchmark results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique in the automatic extraction of burnt areas, outperforming all other methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.},
